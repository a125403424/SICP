The reason why the good-enough? does not work well with small numbers.

  If the number of the sqrt function is smaller than 0.001, then good-enough? will return True too soon.
  Example:
  
  x = 0.001
  original guess = 1
  
  guess2 = 0.5005
  guess3 = 0.251249
  guess4 = 0.127615
  ...
  guess5 â‰ˆ 0.012 0.006 0.003 0.0015
  
  When the guuss is 0.0015, the good-enough? will return True, but 0.0015 is obviously not the square-root of 0.001.

The reason why the good-enough? does not work well with large numbers.

Alternative good-enough?
